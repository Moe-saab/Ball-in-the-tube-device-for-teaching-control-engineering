# Ball-in-the-tube-device-for-teaching-control-engineering
Using linear control theory, identification, model verification, and finally control is done on the ball in the tube system. In addition to that cascaded control is done results in very high agreement between controlled model and controlled real system.  
In the give software, you are free to use only system as a whole to implement a controller based on a direct model from the motor input voltage (duty cycle input) to the output distance measured from the infrared sensor.  
If you want to improve the control, use cascaded control. For this use the ball subsystem and motor subsystem folders.  
You can use or share any part of this work.
